Requires at least: 5.0
Tested up to: 6.4
Stable tag: 0.7.3

Calculate VAT tax at checkout and allow customers with a VAT Number to avoid the tax.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new section on the Membership Checkout form titled "European Union Residents VAT". The customer can select their EU country of residence from a drop-down box or enter their VAT number to avoid the tax. The entered VAT number is validated using the SOAP service provided through the European Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/technicalInformation.html).

VAT rates are automatically calculated based on the constant rates defined in the plugin. The rates in our plugin are those currently listed by the European Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/index_en.htm)

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have the Paid Memberships Pro plugin installed and activated.
1. Upload the `pmpro-vat-tax` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
1. Update your payment settings to make sure you are collecting billing address at checkout.
1. If you are using a gateway like PayPal Express that doesn't collect a billing address, install and activate the Add Address for Free Levels addon.

* ENHANCEMENT: Improved text domain and localization. (@JarrydLong)
* ENHANCEMENT: Improved accessibility by adjusting HTML heading tags to the correct size. (@michaelbeil)
* ENHANCEMENT: Using pmpro_is_checkout for improved reliability to figure out if we need to run code on the checkout page. (@dparker1005)

= 0.7.1 - 2021-01-28 =
* ENHANCEMENT: Added additional validation for UK VAT numbers. (Thanks, nikifoth on GitHub)

= 0.7 - 2021-01-27 =
* ENHANCEMENT: UK VAT numbers are automatically validated as true. The EU API no longer supports UK VAT numbers. The UK VAT APIs are difficult for end users to integrate with.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added Sweedish translation files.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added the pmprovat_hide_vat_if_same_country filter. Enable through custom code.

= .6 - 2020-11-03
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated Romanian VAT to 19%. (Thanks, Mirco Babini)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added German language files. (Thanks, Maja Benke)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmprovat_skip_validation filter. If set to __return_true, the VAT verification API request will be skipped. This is useful if you do VAT verification manually later or have a high traffic site that would hit rate limits. (Thanks, Mirco Babini)
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed warnings and notices.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now correctly calculating the tax amount and subtotal on recurring orders. Requires PMPro v2.5+.
* BUG FIX: No longer double applying tax on recurring orders, which was happening in some cases.

= .5.2 =
* ENHANCEMENT: Improved fields display on membership checkout page to use no tables for compatibility with Paid Memberships Pro v1.9.4.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmprovat_calculated_taxes filter to modify TAX amount (in support of different VAT rates for different products, not charging VAT for certain products/levels, etc)

= .5.1 =
* BUG FIX: Incorrect function name resulted in Order export not working
* BUG FIX: If seller country feature was enabled, VAT number section was still shown.
* BUG FIX: Fixed incorrect CSS class when displaying verified text for VAT number verification.

= .5 =
* FEATURE: Added GEOIP support. Must install and activate the GeoIP Detect plugin.
* BUG: We didn't need to convert GB to UK when validating VAT numbers. The VAT service expects GB. That's the EU code.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Updated the AJAX code to avoid issues on sites with PHP warnings/etc.

= .4.1 =
* BUG: The United Kingdom has the ISO country code GB but VAT uses UK. Similarly Greece has the ISO country code GR but VAT uses EL. We are still using the ISO code in the internal arrays of this addon so we can compare them to the ISO codes used in the billing country PMPro already captures. However, we are now swapping GB to UK and GR to EL when validating the VAT number and storing the "VAT Country" in order notes, on the invoices page, and in the order CSV export.

= .4 =
* BUG: Fixed bug where checkouts to non-EU countries with the EU Country value not set were failing. These checkouts should go through fine without VAT applied.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Hiding VAT stuff from free levels and not requiring an EU country.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now saving the VAT Number, VAT Country, and VAT Tax Rate to the order notes.
* ENHANCEMENT: Also added VAT Number, VAT Country, and VAT Tax Rate to the orders export CSV.
* ENHANCEMENT: Also added VAT Number, VAT Country, and VAT Tax Rate to the invoice bullets.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmprovat_getTaxRate($country, $state = NULL) function to get tax rates out of our global array.
* ENHANCEMENT: Can choose a "Seller Country" from the payment settings page. In the future, we may disallow customers from the same member country as the vendor from using their VAT Number for exemption. However, we need to verify the legal details of that first. For now, the seller country is just stored in the DB as an option.
* ENHANCEMENT: Better wrapping of strings for localization.

* ENHANCEMENT: Now setting the country of residence to the billing address if the country of residence is blank when the billing address is changed.
